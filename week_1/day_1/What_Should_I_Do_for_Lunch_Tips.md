### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry) {
    console.log("Get back to work");
  } else {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Pick something up and eat it in the lab");
    }
    if (20 <= availableTime && availableTime < 30) {
      console.log("Try a place nearby");
    }
    if (availableTime > 30) {
      console.log("You are in a bootcamp and you should reconsider how much time you actually have to spare");
    }
  }
};
